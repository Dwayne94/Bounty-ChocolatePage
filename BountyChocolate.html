                        <p>
                            Bounty is a coconut-filled, chocolate-enrobed candy bar manufactured by Mars, Incorporated, introduced in 1951 
                            in the United Kingdom and Canada. It is a direct emulation of the Mounds bar introduced by Peter Paul in 1936, 
                            and also copies the milk chocolate enrobing of Hershey's Almond Joy, introduced in 1948. It is no longer 
                            domestically sold within the United States, only being available via import sales.

                        <h2>Bounty Flavours</h2>
                        <p>
                            Bounty has a coconut filling, enrobed with milk chocolate (in a blue wrapper) or dark chocolate 
                            (in a red wrapper) and is usually sold as two small bars wrapped in one package. 
                            
                            Since 2006, a cherry-flavoured version has also been available in Australia. This was initially a limited 
                            edition flavour, but remained available as of 2013. In Europe, a limited edition mango flavour was available 
                            in 2004-05 and in Russia and Ukraine in 2010. A pineapple-flavoured edition was available in Russia during 
                            2014. 
                            
                            Although Bounty is no longer distributed by Mars in the United States, similar products, such as Mounds and 
                            Almond Joy, are marketed by Hershey's. On 3 November 2022, it was announced that Bounty bars would be removed 
                            from some Celebrations tubs in the United Kingdom after the manufacturers found that 40% of people hated them. 
                            A limited run of "No Bounty" tubs would be available, in the weeks before Christmas. But a final decision had 
                            not been made after 18% of people named the Bounty as their favourite.
